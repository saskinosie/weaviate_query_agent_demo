    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/scottaskinosie/weaviate_query_agent_demo/blob/main/weaviate_query_agent.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll walk you through a comprehensive example showcasing the **Weaviate Query Agent** functionality.  \n",
    "The Query Agent is an intelligent layer that sits on top of your Weaviate vector database, using generative AI to optimize natural language queries and automatically determine the best search strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Query Agent Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Query Agent intelligently handles complex queries by:\n",
    "- **Query Optimization**: Uses generative AI to transform natural language into optimized vector database queries\n",
    "- **Collection Selection**: Automatically determines which collection(s) to search based on your question\n",
    "- **Smart Filtering**: Decides when filtering is needed to narrow down results\n",
    "- **Aggregation Logic**: Determines if aggregation operations should be performed (counts, grouping, etc.)\n",
    "- **Execution**: Runs the optimized queries against your Weaviate instance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Query Agent using three diverse collections:\n",
    "- **Books**: 10,000 books with titles, authors, descriptions, and genres\n",
    "- **Brands**: 104 clothing brands with descriptions, ratings, and company information  \n",
    "- **Ecommerce**: 448 fashion items with prices, categories, reviews, and brand associations\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets come pre-vectorized with **Snowflake Arctic Embed v2.0** embeddings via Weaviate's embedding service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out the datasets on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents) \n",
    "- Learn more about Query Agents in the [official documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/agents/query)\n",
    "- Explore the technical implementation in our [Query Agent tutorial](https://docs.weaviate.io/agents/query/tutorial-ecommerce)\n",
    "- Understand vector databases in the [Weaviate developer docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate)\n",
